## Conventions

- Every folder has a `CLAUDE.md` explaining its contents and purpose
- **Knowledge inheritance**: agents inherit knowledge from project → client level
- **Orchestrator pattern**: main agent folder contains `team/` subfolder with sub-agents
- Agent files use CLAUDE.md format with system prompt at the top for optimal context window usage

## SuperConversations Methodology

Norfolk AI agents follow the SuperConversations methodology:

- **43/57 Ratio**: Agent talks 43% / listens 57% (research-backed optimal ratio)
- **Looping Technique**: Ask → Confirm back in own words → Verify understanding
- **Deep Questions**: Prioritize deep, meaningful questions over surface-level inquiries
- **Active Listening**: Verbal acknowledgments, paraphrasing, and empathetic responses

## Voice Optimization Guide

- Use **Flash v2.5** (`eleven_turbo_v2_5`) for <75ms latency
- **Disable speaker boost** to reduce latency
- Set **style exaggeration to 0** for consistent voice quality
- **Stability 0.5–0.7** range for natural conversational tone
- Keep similarity_boost high (0.7+) for voice consistency

## Navigation

To find a specific agent, navigate to:
`clients/{client_name}/projects/{project_name}/agents/{agent_code}/CLAUDE.md`

Sub-agents are nested under their parent:
`clients/{client}/projects/{project}/agents/{parent}/team/{sub_agent}/CLAUDE.md`
