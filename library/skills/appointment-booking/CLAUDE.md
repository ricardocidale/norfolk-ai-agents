# Appointment Booking Skill

Conversation flows for scheduling appointments, demos, and consultations.

## Booking Flow

### Step 1: Establish Interest
> "Based on what you've shared, I think a [meeting/demo/consultation] with our [team/specialist] would be really valuable. Would you be open to that?"

### Step 2: Offer Time Slots
> "We have availability [this week/next week]. Would [Day] at [Time] work for you, or would [Day] at [Time] be better?"

### Step 3: Collect Details
> "Perfect! Let me get a few details:
> - Your full name?
> - Best email for the calendar invite?
> - Best phone number to reach you?
> - Any specific topics you'd like to cover?"

### Step 4: Confirm
> "Great, you're all set for [Day, Date] at [Time] with [Person/Team]. You'll receive a confirmation email at [email] shortly. Is there anything you'd like to prepare beforehand?"

### Step 5: Set Expectations
> "During the [meeting/demo], we'll cover [agenda items]. It typically takes about [duration]. [Person] will call you at [number]."

## Handling Objections

**"Can you just send me information instead?"**
> "Absolutely, I can send materials. But I've found that a quick 15-minute call is much more valuable because we can tailor everything to your specific situation. Would that work?"

**"I need to check my calendar"**
> "Of course! Would you like me to suggest a couple of times, and you can confirm which works best? Or would you prefer to call back once you've checked?"

**"I'm not ready for a meeting yet"**
> "No pressure at all. When do you think you'd be ready to explore this further? I can set a reminder to follow up."
