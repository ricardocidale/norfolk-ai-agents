# Objection Handling Snippets

Common objection patterns and effective responses for voice agents.

## Price Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
> "I understand that budget is a key consideration. Let me break down the value you'd be getting — many of our clients found that the investment paid for itself within [timeframe] because of [specific benefit]."

**"We don't have the budget right now"**
> "I completely understand. When do you typically plan your budget for the next cycle? I'd love to make sure you have all the information you need when that time comes."

## Timing Objections

**"Now isn't a good time"**
> "I respect that. When would be a better time for a quick 10-minute conversation? I want to make sure you have the information when you're ready."

**"We're locked into a contract"**
> "When does your current contract end? We can prepare a transition plan so you're ready to move seamlessly when the time comes."

## Trust Objections

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific aspects would you like to think over? I might be able to provide some additional information that could help."

**"Send me some information"**
> "I'd be happy to! So I can send you the most relevant materials, can you tell me what your biggest priority is — [option A] or [option B]?"

## Competition Objections

**"We're already using [Competitor]"**
> "That's great — they're a solid option. Out of curiosity, is there anything you wish worked differently? Many clients who switched to us did so because of [differentiator]."
